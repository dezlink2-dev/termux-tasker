### Installation

Latest version is `v0.9.0`.

Check [`termux-app` Installation](https://github.com/termux/termux-app#Installation) for details before reading forward.

### F-Droid

`Termux:Tasker` application can be obtained from `F-Droid` from [here](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux.tasker/).

You **do not** need to download the `F-Droid` app (via the `Download F-Droid` link) to install `Termux:Tasker`. You can download the `Termux:Tasker` APK directly from the site by clicking the `Download APK` link at the bottom of each version section.

It usually takes a few days (or even a week or more) for updates to be available on `F-Droid` once an update has been released on `Github`. The `F-Droid` releases are built and published by `F-Droid` once they [detect](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/blob/master/metadata/com.termux.tasker.yml) a new `Github` release. The Termux maintainers **do not** have any control over the building and publishing of the Termux apps on `F-Droid`. Moreover, the Termux maintainers also do not have access to the APK signing keys of `F-Droid` releases, so we cannot release an APK ourselves on `Github` that would be compatible with `F-Droid` releases.

The `F-Droid` app often may not notify you of updates and you will manually have to do a pull down swipe action in the `Updates` tab of the app for it to check updates. Make sure battery optimizations are disabled for the app, check https://dontkillmyapp.com/ for details on how to do that.

### Github

`Termux:Tasker` application can be obtained on `Github` either from [`Github Releases`](https://github.com/termux/termux-tasker/releases) for version `>= 0.6.0` or from [`Github Actions`](https://github.com/termux/termux-tasker/actions/workflows/github_action_build.yml?query=branch%3Amaster+event%3Apush).

The APKs for `Github Releases` will be listed under `Assets` drop-down of the release. These are automatically attached when a new version is released.

The APKs for `Github Actions` will be listed under `Artifacts` section of the workflow run. These are created for each commit/push done to the repository and can be used by users who don't want to wait for releases and want to try out the latest features immediately or want to test their pull requests. Note that for action workflows, you need to be [**logged into a `Github` account**](https://github.com/login) for the `Artifacts` links to be enabled/clickable. If you are using the [`Github` app](https://github.com/mobile), then make sure to open workflow link in a browser like Chrome or Firefox that has your Github account logged in since the in-app browser may not be logged in.

The APKs for both of these are [`debuggable`](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug) and are compatible with each other but they are not compatible with other sources.

### Google Play Store **(Deprecated)**

**Termux and its plugins are no longer updated on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux.tasker) due to [android 10 issues](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/Termux-and-Android-10) and have been deprecated. It is highly recommended to not install Termux apps from Play Store any more.** Check https://github.com/termux/termux-app#google-play-store-deprecated for details.
##



### Setup Instructions

#### Install `Termux` app (Mandatory)
The `Termux:Tasker` plugin requires [Termux] app to run the actual commands. You need to install it and start it at least once and have it install the bootstrap files for the plugin to start working. The Termux prefix directory `/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/` and Termux home directory `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/` must also exist and must have read, write and execute permissions `(0700)` for the plugin to work. The `$PREFIX/` is shortcut for the Termux [prefix directory](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/Termux-file-system-layout) and can also be referred by the `$PREFIX` shell environment variable. The `~/` is a shortcut for the Termux home directory and can also be referred by the `$HOME` shell environment variable. Note that `~/` will not expand inside single or double quotes when running commands. Permissions and ownerships can be checked with the `stat <path>` command.


#### `com.termux.permission.RUN_COMMAND` permission (Mandatory)

For `Termux:Tasker` version `>= 0.5`, the plugin host app will need to be granted the `com.termux.permission.RUN_COMMAND` permission to run **ANY** plugin commands. This is a security measure to prevent any other apps from running commands in `Termux` context which do not have the required permission granted to them. This is also required for the [RUN_COMMAND Intent].

The [Tasker] app has requested the permission since `v5.9.3`, so you will need to update the app if you are using an older version. You can grant the permission using the `Permissions` activity in the `App Info` activity of your plugin host app. For `Tasker` you can grant it with: `Android Settings` -> `Apps` -> `Tasker` -> `Permissions` -> `Additional permissions` -> `Run commands in Termux environment`.

If you do not grant the permission, you will likely get errors like `receiver com.termux.tasker.FireReceiver requires permission com.termux.permission.RUN_COMMAND which we don't have` when running the `Termux:Tasker` plugin action in `Tasker`. Note that, the `%errmsg` for missing permissions will not be set if you are using `Tasker` version `< 5.11.1.beta` and `Continue Task After Error` is enabled, only `%err` will be set to `1`. You can open the plugin configuration screen to detect missing permissions of the plugin host.


#### `~/.termux/tasker/` Directory (Optional)
The `~/.termux/tasker/` directory stores the scripts that can be run with the plugin without setting `allow-external-apps` property to `true` if you do not want to use absolute paths. Open a non-root termux session and run the below command to create it and give it read, write and executable permissions `(0700)`. The `tasker` directory must have read permission, otherwise the plugin will not be able to read the script files and give errors like `No regular file found at path` for any script name entered in the `Executable` field of plugin configuration. The `tasker` directory of the script must also have executable permissions for the script to be allowed to execute.

```
mkdir -p /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.termux/tasker
chmod 700 -R /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.termux
```


#### `allow-external-apps` property (Optional)

`Termux:Tasker` version `>= 0.5` also allows commands to be run outside the `~/.termux/tasker/` directory by setting absolute paths in the `Executable` field of the plugin configuration **ONLY** if `allow-external-apps` property is set to `true` in `~/.termux/termux.properties` file. This is an added security measure. **DO NOT** set it to true if you have given a relatively untrusted app `com.termux.permission.RUN_COMMAND` permission, since it will be able to run arbitrary commands in termux or even root context (assuming termux has been granted root permissions) in the background without user intervention. The `~/.termux` directory must have read permission, otherwise the plugin will not be able to read the property values. This is also required for the [RUN_COMMAND Intent] intent.

- Automatic
    You can use the one-liner commands below to set the desired value. The commands will append the desired value using `echo` command to the file if the file doesn't exist or the property doesn't exist in the file, otherwise it will `sed` replace any existing values of the key with the desired value.  

    To set `allow-external-apps` property to `true`.  

    ```
    value="true"; key="allow-external-apps"; file="/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.termux/termux.properties"; mkdir -p "$(dirname "$file")"; chmod 700 "$(dirname "$file")"; if ! grep -E '^'"$key"'=.*' $file &>/dev/null; then [[ -s "$file" && ! -z "$(tail -c 1 "$file")" ]] && newline=$'\n' || newline=""; echo "$newline$key=$value" >> "$file"; else sed -i'' -E 's/^'"$key"'=.*/'"$key=$value"'/' $file; fi
    ```

    To set `allow-external-apps` property to `false`.  

    ```
    value="false"; key="allow-external-apps"; file="/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.termux/termux.properties"; mkdir -p "$(dirname "$file")"; chmod 700 "$(dirname "$file")"; if ! grep -E '^'"$key"'=.*' $file &>/dev/null; then [[ -s "$file" && ! -z "$(tail -c 1 "$file")" ]] && newline=$'\n' || newline=""; echo "$newline$key=$value" >> "$file"; else sed -i'' -E 's/^'"$key"'=.*/'"$key=$value"'/' $file; fi
    ```

- Manual
    You can do it manually by running the below commands to open the `nano` text editor in the terminal. Then add/update a line `allow-external-apps=true` to set the property to `true`, and press `Ctrl+o` and then `Enter` to save and `Ctrl+x` to exit.  

```
    file="/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.termux/termux.properties";
    mkdir -p "$(dirname "$file")";
    nano "$file"
```


#### `Draw Over Apps` permission (Optional)

For android `>= 10` there are new [restrictions](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/background-starts) that prevent activities from starting from the background. This prevents the background `TermuxService` from starting a terminal session in the foreground and running the commands until the user manually clicks `Termux` notification in the status bar dropdown notifications list. This only affects plugin commands that are to be executed in a terminal session and not the background ones. `Termux` version `>= 0.100` requests the `Draw Over Apps` permission so that users can bypass this restriction so that commands can automatically start running without user intervention. You can grant `Termux` the `Draw Over Apps` permission from its `App Info` activity `Android Settings` -> `Apps` -> `Termux` -> `Advanced` -> `Draw over other apps`.
##



### Usage

#### Tasker
1. Create a new `Action` in a `Task`.
2. In the resulting `Select Action Category` dialog, select `Plugin`.
3. In the resulting `Action Plugin` dialog, select `Termux:Tasker`.
4. Click the edit button to edit the configuration.
5. Run the task once the configuration is complete.
##



### Plugin Configuration

The plugin configuration activity can be started by plugin host apps to configure the plugin to define what commands should be run and in which mode.

The text fields support plugin host app local variables (all lowercase) like `%executable`, `%arguments`, `%workdir`, `%stdin`, etc and you may use multiple variables in a single field.

#### `Executable`

The `Executable` text field defines the executable that needs to be run. It can either be set to a file in `~/.termux/tasker/` directory or to an absolute path if `allow-external-apps` property is set to `true` (check [Setup Instructions](#Setup-Instructions)). Absolute paths can be like `/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash`. The `$PREFIX/` and `~/` prefixes are also supported, like `$PREFIX/bin/bash` or `~/some-script`.

Execute permissions will automatically be set for the executable file if it exists inside the `~/.termux/tasker/` directory when the plugin action is run. It is the user's responsibility to set read and execute permissions for the executable file if it exists outside the `~/.termux/tasker/` directory. That can be done by running the command `chmod 700 "/path/to/executable"` from a terminal session before running the plugin action.


#### `Arguments`

The `Arguments` text field defines the argument that will be passed to the executable. For `Termux:Tasker` version `>= 0.5`, arguments will be processed just like there are if commands are run in a shell like bourne shell. It uses [ArgumentTokenizer](https://sourceforge.net/p/drjava/git_repo/ci/master/tree/drjava/src/edu/rice/cs/util/ArgumentTokenizer.java) to parse the arguments string.

Arguemnts are split on a space ` `, tab `\t` or a newline `\n` ([`Character.isWhitespace()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/Character#isWhitespace(char))) unless quoted with single `'` or double quotes `"`. Double quotes and backslashes can be escaped with backslashes in arguments surrounded with double quotes. Using backslash at end of line (`\\n`) to start a new argument is not supported and it will escape the newline and add it to start of the new argument. Internally, [`ArgumentTokenizer`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/master/termux-shared/src/main/java/com/termux/shared/shell/ArgumentTokenizer.java) class is using to convert the arguments string to separate arguments.

Any argument surrounded with single quotes is considered a literal string. However, if an argument itself contains single quotes, then they will need to be escaped properly. You can escape them by replacing all single quotes `'` in an argument value with `'\''` **before** passing the argument surrounded with single quotes. So an argument surrounded with single quotes that would have been passed like `'some arg with single quote ' in it'` will be passed as `'some arg with single quote '\'' in it'`. This is basically 3 parts `'some arg with single quote '`, `\'` and `' in it'` but when processed, it will be considered as one single argument with the value `some arg with single quote ' in it` that is passed to the executable.

For `Tasker`, you can use the `Variable Search Replace` action on an `%argument` variable to escape the single quotes. Set the `Search` field to one single quote `'`, and enable `Replace Matches` toggle, and set `Replace With` field to one single quote, followed by two backslashes, followed by two single quotes `'\\''`. The double backslash is to escape the backslash character itself.


#### `Working directory path`

The `Working directory path` text field for `Termux:Tasker` version `>= 0.5` defines the working directory that should be used while running the command. The directory must be readable by the termux app. It is the user's responsibility to create the directory if its outside the `~/` directory for version `< 0.6.0` and `/data/data/com.termux/files` directory for version `>= 0.6.0`. That can be done by running the command `mkdir -p "/path/to/workdir"` from a terminal session before running the plugin action. The `$PREFIX/` and `~/` prefixes are also supported, like `$PREFIX/some-directory` or `~/some-directory`.


#### `Stdin`

The `Stdin` text field for `Termux:Tasker` version `>= 0.6.0` can be used to pass scripts via standard input (`stdin`), like a `bash` script to the `$PREFIX/bin/bash` shell and a `python` script to the `$PREFIX/bin/python` shell or any other commands. This allows scripts to be defined in the plugin host app instead of defining physical script files in `~/.termux/tasker/` directory. Check [Defining Scripts In Plugin Host App](#defining-scripts-in-plugin-host-app) for details.

Note that if passing script via `stdin`, do not pass arguments, since it will fail depending on shell, at least will for `bash`.

The max supported length of a script is `45K` characters taking into consideration the Tasker plugin bundle limits of `100KB` when its stored in a [`Parcel`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Parcel). On Android `7-11`, the `String` characters are [stored in Parcel as `UTF-16`](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/android-11.0.0_r40:frameworks/base/core/java/android/os/Parcel.java;l=773), i.e `2` bytes. So we use `10KB` for rest of the plugin configuration data and half of the remaining (`90KB`) for storing the script.


#### `Terminal Session Action`

The `Terminal Session Action` text field for `Termux:Tasker` version `>= 0.6.0` defines what should happen when a foreground session command is received for the `Termux`. The user can define whether the new session should be automatically switched to or if existing session should remain as the current session. The user can also define if foreground session commands should open the `TermuxActivity` or if they should run in the *"background"* in the Termux notification. The user can click the notification to open the sessions. The valid values are defined by [`TermuxConstants.TERMUX_APP.TERMUX_SERVICE.VALUE_EXTRA_SESSION_ACTION_*`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/v0.117/termux-shared/src/main/java/com/termux/shared/termux/TermuxConstants.java#L856), currently, between `0` and `3`.


#### `Custom Log Level`

The `Custom Log Level` text field for `Termux:Tasker` version `>= 0.6.0` defines the log level for background commands that should be used by `Termux`.

By default Termux only logs command `stdout` and `stderr` to `logcat` if user has set log level to `VERBOSE` in `Termux` app settings (not `Termux:Tasker`). However, if command outputted too much data to `logcat`, then `logcat` clients like in Android Studio would crash.

So one can pass a custom log level that is `>=` to the log level set it `Termux` app settings where (`OFF=0`, `NORMAL=1`, `DEBUG=2`, `VERBOSE=3`) for custom behaviour. If you pass `0`, it will completely disable logging. If you pass `1`, logging will only be enabled if log level in termux settings is `NORMAL` or higher. If custom log level is not passed, then default behaviour will remain and log level in `Termux` app settings must be `VERBOSE` or higher for logging to be enabled. Note that the log entries will still be logged with priority `Log.VERBOSE` regardless of log level, i.e `logcat` will have `V/`.

The entries `logcat` component will be `TermuxCommand`. For output at `stdout`, the entry format is `[<pid>-stdout] ...` and for the output at `stderr`, the entry format is `[<pid>-stderr] ...`. The `<pid>` will be the process id (`pid`) as an integer that was started by Termux for the executable. For example: `V/TermuxCommand: [66666-stdout] ...`.


##### Using `Custom Log Level` to send commands to Tasker

<details>
<summary></summary>

Instead of using `am` command to send messages back to Tasker, you can use Tasker `Logcat Entry` profile event to listen to messages from Termux at both `stdout` and `stderr`. This might be faster than `am` command intent systems or at least possibly more convenient in some use cases.

So setup a profile with the `Component` value set to `TermuxCommand` and `Filter` value set to `-E 'TermuxCommand: \[[0-9]+-((stdout)|(stderr))\] message_tag: .*'` and enable the `Grep Filter` toggle so that entry matching is done in native code. Check Tasker [Logcat Info](https://github.com/joaomgcd/TaskerDocumentation/blob/master/en/help/logcat%20info.md) documentation for details. Also enable `Enforce Task Order` in profile settings and set collision handling to `Run Both Together` so that if two or more entries are sent quickly, entry task is run for all. Tasker currently (`v5.13.16`) is not maintaining order of entry tasks despite the setting.

Then start a `Termux:Tasker` plugin action with custom log level `1` (assuming current log level is `NORMAL`) and you should be able to receive the entries for whatever you send to `stdout` and `stderr` in your script that starts with `message_tag: ` as `%lc_text` in entry task of tasker `Logcat Entry` profile. You can remove the prefix from the `%lc_text` variable with `Variable Search Replace` action. Set the `Search` field to `TermuxCommand: \[[0-9]+-((stdout)|(stderr))\] message_tag: `, and enable `Replace Matches` toggle, and leave `Replace With` empty.

</details>



#### `Execute in a terminal session`

The `Execute in a terminal session` toggle defines whether the commands will be run in the background or in a foreground terminal session.

If the toggle is **enabled**, a new terminal session will open up automatically in the foreground and commands will be run inside it. Result of commands is **not returned** to the plugin host app for version `< 0.6.0`. For version `>= 0.6.0`, result will be returned in `%stdout` and `%result` variables. The `%stdout` variable will only contain the session transcript and will contain both `stdout` and `stderr` combined, basically anything sent to the the pseudo terminal `/dev/pts`, including `PS1` prefixes for interactive sessions. For foreground commands that exited with failure will require `Termux` app version `>= 0.118.0` for sessions to automatically close without waiting for user to press enter.

If the toggle is **not enabled**, then commands are run in the background and result of commands **is returned** to the plugin host app in `%stdout`, `%stderr` and `%result` variables.

Check [Setup Instructions](#Setup-Instructions) for android `>= 10` restrictions that will prevent the commands from automatically starting unless notification is clicked.


#### `Wait for result for commands`

The `Wait for result for commands` toggle for `Termux:Tasker` version `>= 0.6.0` defines whether the plugin action should wait for result of commands. It will apply to both foreground session and background commands. Check [Plugin Variables](#plugin-variables) for details.


Check [Templates](#Templates) section for templates that can be used for various configurations.
##



### Plugin Variables

Depending on plugin configuration, the following variables may be returned.

- `%stdout` containing `stdout` of commands.
- `%stdout_original_length` containing original length of `stdout`.
- `%stderr` containing `stderr` of commands.
- `%stderr_original_length` containing original length of `stderr`.
- `%result` containing `exit code` of commands. The `exit code` `0` often means success and anything else is usually a failure of some sort.
- `%err` containing `exit code` of plugin action. This will be set only if running the action itself failed like missing permissions or invalid configuration. This may be set by the plugin host app or the plugin. This will not be set if plugin action succeeded.
- `%errmsg` containing the error message of why the plugin action failed if `%err` is set.
&nbsp;

If the timeout value of the plugin action is set to `0` or `None` (slider to extreme left in Tasker), then **no variables will be returned**, regardless of whether commands need to be run in a foreground terminal session or in background. Even `%errmsg` will not be set to notify of any errors while running the plugin action since plugin host app will not wait for the plugin to return any variables. This is important for cases like if `allow-external-apps` is not set to `true` but an absolute path outside `~/.termux/tasker/` directory is set as the `Executable`, in which case the plugin action will appear to have succeeded but no commands will execute.

If the timeout value of the plugin action is set to `>0` and `Wait for result for commands` toggle is enabled, then the result of commands will be returned in `%stdout`, `%stderr` (only background) and `%result` variables. The `%err` and `%errmsg` variables may also be set if the action failed. Note that if the timeout has passed by the time commands finish, the result of command variables will not be set in the plugin host app task and the action will exit with a timeout error, the `%err` variable will be set to `2` and `%errmsg` to `timeout`, at least in `Tasker`.

If the timeout value of the plugin action is set to `>0` and `Wait for result for commands` toggle is not enabled, then `%stdout`, `%stderr` and `%result` variables will **not** be returned. Only the `%err` and `%errmsg`variables may be set if the action failed.

The (new) default timeout is set to `10s` for all configurations. If you are running background commands that will likely take longer to run, then increase the timeout or set it to `Never` (slider to extreme right in Tasker). The plugin host app may still get killed by android if it keeps running for long time regardless of timeout value, check [here](https://tasker.joaoapps.com/userguide/en/faqs/faq-problem.html#00) for more info. Even if the commands are to be run in a foreground terminal session, **do not** set timeout to `0` but use `10s` instead, since with timeout `0`, plugin host app will not wait for any errors to be returned by the plugin in `%err` and `%errmsg` variables and continue the task and the user wouldn't know if any error occurred. Users who already have preexisting actions with the timeout set to `0`, like for foreground terminal session commands (considering previous default was `0`) should update their tasks and use the new default `10s` instead, just opening the configuration screen and returning should automatically do it.
&nbsp;


For `Termux:Tasker` version `>= 0.5`, the `%errmsg`, `%stdout`, `%stderr` and `%result` variables will also be automatically cleared whenever the action is run if timeout is greater than `0` to solve the issue of if multiple actions are run in the same task, then variables from previous action may still be set and get mixed in with current ones. For older versions, you can use a `Variable Clear` action in Tasker with `Pattern Matching` enabled and the `Name` field set to `%errmsg/%stdout/%stderr/%result` to clear all of them before each plugin action if multiple actions are run in a task or `Local Variable Passthrough` is enabled in Tasker.

The `%err` and `%errmsg` variables will mainly only be set for `Termux:Tasker` version `>= 0.5`. These will be set if there are errors like if an executable file is not found, or if `allow-external-apps` property is not set to `true` but an absolute path is specified as the executable. `Tasker` itself may set it too like if `Tasker` has not been granted the `com.termux.permission.RUN_COMMAND` permission when running the plugin action or if a timeout occurs, etc.

The `%err` and `%errmsg` variables must be stored in another variable with the `Variable Set` action right after the plugin action if they have to be checked and used later. The plugin host app like Tasker sets and clears `%err` for each action and it is only available in the next action. To check if and what they are set to, add a `Variable Clear` action for `%command_failed` variable before the plugin action, then add a `Variable Set` action after the plugin action for the `%command_failed` variable with the value `%err %errmsg` and `If` conditions `If %err Set OR If %errmsg Set`. Then you can just check `If %command_failed Set` afterward and flash it to notify the user or exit the task if necessary. Error checking should ideally also be done based on `%result` and optionally the `%stderr` variables before continuing the task.
&nbsp;


The `%stdout_original_length` and `%stderr_original_length` can be used to check if `%stdout` and `%stderr` were truncated by `Termux` app before sending them back to plugin host app in case they were too large and would have triggered `TransactionTooLargeException`. The `stdout` and `stderr` sent back will be truncated from the start to max `100KB` combined. The `errmsg` will also be truncated from end to max `25KB`. Check [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/commit/f62febbf) and [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/commit/a2209ddd) for details.

Check [Templates](#Templates) section for templates on how error and result variables should be handled for various configurations.

### Templates

The templates were written for version `< 0.6.0` and currently have not been updated for version `>= 0.6.0`.

#### Tasker

- `Tasks`
    - `XML`
        Download the [Termux Tasker Plugin Basic Templates Task XML](templates/plugin_hosts/tasker/Termux_Tasker_Plugin_Basic_Templates.tsk.xml) file to the android download directory. To download, right-click or hold the `Raw` button at the top after opening a file link and select `Download/Save link` or use `curl` from a termux shell. Then import the downloaded task file into Tasker by long pressing the `Task` tab button in Tasker home and selecting `Import Task`.  

        `curl -L 'https://github.com/termux/termux-tasker/raw/master/templates/plugin_hosts/tasker/Termux_Tasker_Plugin_Basic_Templates.tsk.xml' -o "/sdcard/Download/Termux_Tasker_Plugin_Basic_Templates.tsk.xml"`  

    - `Taskernet`
        Import `Termux Tasker Plugin Basic Templates Task` from `Taskernet` from [here](https://taskernet.com/shares/?user=AS35m8mXdvaT1Vj8TwkSaCaoMUv220IIGtHe3pG4MymrCUhpgzrat6njEOnDVVulhAIHLi6BPUt1&id=Task%3ATermux+Tasker+Plugin+Basic+Templates).  

    Check [Termux Tasker Plugin Basic Templates Task Info](templates/plugin_hosts/tasker/Termux_Tasker_Plugin_Basic_Templates.tsk.md) file for more info on the task.  

- `Scripts`
    To use the above task, you will also need to place the [termux_tasker_basic_bash_test](templates/scripts/termux_tasker_basic_bash_test) and [termux_tasker_basic_python_test](templates/scripts/termux_tasker_basic_python_test) scripts in `~/.termux/tasker/` directory after following its [Setup Instructions](#Setup-Instructions). They basically just print the first `2` args to `stdout` if only `2` args are received, otherwise exit with error.  

    1. Download the script files.  

        - Download to `~/.termux/tasker/` directly from github using `curl` using a non-root termux shell.  

            `curl -L 'https://github.com/termux/termux-tasker/raw/master/templates/scripts/termux_tasker_basic_bash_test' -o "/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.termux/tasker/termux_tasker_basic_bash_test"`  

            `curl -L 'https://github.com/termux/termux-tasker/raw/master/templates/scripts/termux_tasker_basic_python_test' -o "/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.termux/tasker/termux_tasker_basic_python_test"`  

        - Download them manually to android download directory and then use `cat` to copy them to `~/.termux/tasker/` or manually do it with a [SAF file browser](#Creating-And-Modifying-Scripts).  

            `cat "/sdcard/Download/termux_tasker_basic_bash_test" > "/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.termux/tasker/termux_tasker_basic_bash_test"`  

            `cat "/sdcard/Download/termux_tasker_basic_python_test" > "/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.termux/tasker/termux_tasker_basic_python_test"`  

    2. Set executable permissions.  

        `chmod 700 "/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.termux/tasker/termux_tasker_basic_bash_test"`  

        `chmod 700 "/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.termux/tasker/termux_tasker_basic_python_test"`  


    To modify the scripts you can use `nano`.  

    `nano "/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.termux/tasker/termux_tasker_basic_bash_test"`  
    `nano "/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.termux/tasker/termux_tasker_basic_python_test"`  


Termux needs to be granted `Storage` permission to allow it to access `/sdcard/Download` directory, otherwise you will get permission denied errors while running commands.

### Creating And Modifying Scripts

You can create scripts in `~/.termux/tasker/` directory after following its [Setup Instructions](#Setup-Instructions). Scripts can also be created elsewhere in Termux files directory but will require `allow-external-apps` to be set to `true` for the plugin to access them.

You can use `shell` based text editors like `nano`, `vim` or `emacs` to create and modify scripts.

`nano ~/.termux/tasker/some_script`

You can also use `GUI` based text editor android apps that support `SAF`. Termux provides a [Storage Access Framework (SAF)](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Internal_and_external_storage) file provider to allow other apps to access its `~/` home directory. However, the `$PREFIX/` directory is not accessible to other apps. The [QuickEdit] or [QuickEdit Pro] app does support `SAF` and can handle large files without crashing, however, it is closed source and its pro version without ads is paid. You can also use [Acode editor] or [Turbo Editor] if you want an open source app.

Note that the android default `SAF` `Document` file picker may not support hidden file or directories like `~/.termux` which start with a dot `.`, so if you try to use it to open files for a text editor app, then that directory will not show. You can instead create a symlink for  `~/.termux` at `~/termux_sym` so that it is shown. Use `ln -s "/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.termux" "/data/data/com.termux/files/home/termux_sym"` to create it.

### Debugging

You can help debug problems like how arguments are being parsed by the plugin or if the plugin is even firing etc by setting appropriate `logcat` `Log Level` in options menu (3 dots) in the plugin configuration screen or in `Termux` app settings -> `Termux:Tasker` -> `Debugging` -> `Log Level` (Requires `Termux` app version `>= 0.113`). Note that whatever log level is set will affect the entire plugin app and all plugin actions and not just for the action whose configuration you used to set it. The setting only exists inside the configuration activity of actions because creating a separate launcher activity that would be shown in the list of apps in the launcher just for this setting doesn't seem worth it. The `Log Level` defaults to `Normal` and log level `Verbose` currently logs additional information. Its best to revert log level to `Normal` after you have finished debugging since private data may otherwise be passed to `logcat` during normal operation and moreover, additional logging increases execution time.

The plugin **does not execute the commands itself** but sends an execution intent to `Termux` app, which has its own log level which can be set in `Termux` app settings -> `Termux` -> `Debugging` -> `Log Level`. So you must set log level for both `Termux` and `Termux:Tasker` app settings to get all the info.

Once log levels have been set, you can run the `logcat` command in `Termux` app terminal to view the logs in realtime (`Ctrl+c` to stop) or use `logcat -d > logcat.txt` to take a dump of the log. You can also view the logs from a PC over `ADB`. For more information, check official android `logcat` guide [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat).

##### Log Levels

- `Off` - Log nothing.
- `Normal` - Start logging error, warn and info messages and stacktraces.
- `Debug` - Start logging debug messages.
- `Verbose` - Start logging verbose messages.

### Worthy Of Note

##### Arguments and Result Data Limits

There are limits on the arguments size you can pass to commands or the full command string length that can be run, which is likely equal to `131072` bytes or `128KB` for an android device defined by `ARG_MAX` but after subtracting shell environment size, etc, it will roughly be around `120-125KB` but limits may vary for different android versions and kernels. You can check the limits for a given termux session by running `true | xargs --show-limits`. If you exceed the limit, you will get exceptions like `Argument list too long`. You can manually cross the limit by running something like `$PREFIX/bin/echo "$(head -c 131072 < /dev/zero | tr '\0' 'a')" | tr -d 'a'`, use full path of `echo`, otherwise the `echo` shell built-in will be called to which the limit does not apply since `exec` is not done.

Moreover, exchanging data between `Tasker` and `Termux:Tasker` is done using [Intents](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/parcelables-and-bundles), like sending the command and receiving result of commands in `%stdout` and `%stderr`. However, android has limits on the size of *actual* data that can be sent through intents, it is roughly `500KB` on android `7` but may be different for different android versions. The `Termux` app based on testing still sets a safe limit at `100KB` and will truncate any data higher than that. Check `%stdout_original_length` and `%stderr_original_length` in [Plugin Variables](#plugin-variables) section for details.

Basically, make sure any data/arguments you send to `Termux:Tasker` is less than `120KB` (or whatever you found) and any expected result sent back is less than `100KB`, but best keep it as low as possible for greater portability. If you want to exchange an even larger data between tasker and termux, use physical files instead.

The argument data limits also apply for the [RUN_COMMAND Intent].


##### Termux Environment

Termux does not load the environment fully for external plugins or [RUN_COMMAND Intent] commands, like setting `LD_PRELOAD`, so any *external* scripts which do not have shebangs to full path to termux bin directory will not work if called from inside your *plugin* scripts, since `libtermux-exec.so` is not called since `LD_PRELOAD` isn't set and you will get `bad interpreter: No such file or directory` errors. Simply setting `LD_PRELOAD` will not work either without starting a new shell. So make sure to set the shebangs correctly for any *external* scripts you want to run from inside your *plugin* script. The correct shebangs for termux scripts are like `#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash` for bash scripts instead of `#!/usr/bin/bash` used in common linux distros. You can also use [termux-fix-shebang](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux-fix-shebang) command on the *external* scripts before running them with the plugin to fix the shebangs automatically or use `tudo`/`sudo` mentioned below.


##### Defining Scripts In Plugin Host App

Any script files that need to be run need to be created in `~/.termux/tasker/` directory. It may get inconvenient to create physical script files for each type of command you want to run. These script files are also neither part of backups of plugin host apps like Tasker and require separate backup methods and nor are part of project configs shared with other people or even between your own devices, and so the scripts need to be added manually to the `~/.termux/tasker/` directory on each device.

To solve such issues and to dynamically define scripts of different interpreted languages inside your plugin host app like `Tasker` and to pass them to `Termux` as arguments instead of creating script files, you can either use [`Stdin`](#stdin) plugin configuration field or use `tudo` or `sudo`.

The [`tudo`](https://github.com/agnostic-apollo/tudo) script can be used for running commands in termux user context and the [`sudo`](https://github.com/agnostic-apollo/sudo) script for running commands with super user (root) context, check their `script` command type. These scripts will also load the termux environment properly like setting `LD_PRELOAD` etc before running the commands. There are much more customizable then using `Stdin` and support things that aren't possible to be provided via the plugin.
